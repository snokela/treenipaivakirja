# **Workout Diary App**
This React Native application was created as a part of the Introduction to Mobile Services course at Oulu University of Applied Sciences. The app allows users to add and track workouts, view workout history and customize settings for unit preferences (kilometers or miles).

## **Features**
- **Add Workouts:** Log workout details including sport type, distance, duration and date. Input validations ensure only positive numeric values for distance and duration.
- **Workout History:** View a scrollable list of past workouts with the total distance per workout type displayed at the top. Pre-loaded with example workouts for immediate functionality.
- **Settings:** Choose between kilometers and miles. All distances are stored in kilometers but displayed in the chosen unit, with conversions handled automatically.
- **User-Friendly Navigation:** Seamlessly navigate between views using custom styles and icons with bottom navigation, enhancing the user experience.

This project showcases custom styling and the use of external libraries like React Native Paper, demonstrating the basics of mobile application design and state management in React Native.
